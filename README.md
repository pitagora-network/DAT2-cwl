# DAT2-CWL

This repository contains the Common Workflow Language (CWL) definitions of the workflows introduced in the book [#NGS_DAT 2nd edition (A tutorial book in Japanese, 次世代シークエンサー DRY 解析教本 改訂第 2 版)](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/478090983X).

## Learn how to run CWL

There are many online documents to learn about CWL out there:

- [The official website](https://www.commonwl.org/)
- [Getting started](https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/)
- [Getting started in Japanese](https://github.com/pitagora-galaxy/cwl/wiki/CWL-Start-Guide-JP)
- [The workflow meetup Tokyo/Osaka](https://github.com/manabuishii/workflow-meetup/wiki/20180418)
  - Slack workspace and invitation code is on the website
- [Pitagora Network](https://pitagora-network.org/)
  - a monthly meetup in Tokyo for bioinformatics workflow users and developers

## Workflow test status

All workflows introduced in the book has been translated in CWL, but yet the testing is ongoing.

## Troubleshooting

Please create an issue on [github issue](https://github.com/pitagora-network/DAT2-cwl/issues) if you have any trouble with the workflows. For questions to Common Workflow Language, please go to [discourse group](https://cwl.discourse.group/) of CWL - the experts will help you.
